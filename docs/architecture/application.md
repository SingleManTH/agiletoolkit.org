# Architecture & Design > Anatomy Of An Application

## The Class Hierarchy

In order to implement the Composability and Extensibility that make Agile Toolkit so productive we need to provide every object with a number of common features.

So at the top of the class hierarchy is `AbstractObject`, which primarily handles the creation, naming and initialization of objects.

There are three classes which extend directly from `AbstractObject`:

* **AbstractModel**: which adds features to help manage data entities
* **AbstractView**: which adds features for generating output with nested templates
* **AbstractController**: which is the root class for all Controllers.

All other classes descend from one of these three abstract classes, so all objects in Agile Toolkit are either Models, Views or Controllers.

So while most modern PHP frameworks aim at decoupling their code, Agile Toolkit is a tightly integrated system. Like any design decision this involves tradeoffs: your code is somewhat less portable to other frameworks, but in return you enjoy the unique productivity features of the Toolkit.

## The Runtime Object Tree

In a related departure from conventional design, objects in Agile Toolkit are always instantiated inside a parent object using the `AbstractObject add()` method rather than the PHP `new` statement. Again, this is to assist with our Composability design goal. 

So an Agile Toolkit application is a runtime tree of objects nested inside other objects. This enables us to render our Models and Views recursively into a single integrated request response.

## The Execution Flow

Now you understand the Runtime Object Tree we can walk though the basic anatomy of an HTTP request.

![Agile Toolkit Execution Flow](dia-execution-flow.png)

1. First, your webserver is configured to run the `index.php` file in your webroot for all page requests. This simply bootstraps your application with 3 lines of code:

    <pre>
    include 'atk4/loader.php';

    // Set up the application object
    $api=new Frontend('sample_project');

    // Run the application
    $api->main();
    </pre>
    
1. `Frontend.php` is known as the `$app` object &ndash; it's the topmost object in the Runtime Object Tree. `Frontend` extends one of the Core API classes, which are tailored to give you just the application features you need for different kinds of request, such as Command Line requests or REST requests. For a normal page request you would generally use `ApiFrontend`.

1. In `Frontend.php` you set up your database connections, configure your class loading, and initialize access security and application-wide Controllers.

1. Now the application cascades down the Runtime Object Tree initializing all the objects required to fulfil the request...

1. The `$app` object will route the request to the correct Page class in your `/page` directory, throwing a 404 Page Not Found error if no matching page is found.

1. The Page will orchestrate the necessary Views and Models, and these will load any Controllers they require.

1. The Views use the SMLite template engine to generate their HTML output, and the Models use the DSQL (Dynamic SQL) Query Builder to generate runtime SQL.

1. Once all objects are initialized, the `$app` will recursively render the nested tree of Views and echo out the response.

## The Application Core

The Agile Toolkit Core sits in the `/atk4` directory and handles the plumbing of your application. The key features are:

* [Configuration](/TODO): configuring the application and Controllers
* [Class Loading](/TODO): automatic lazy loading of classes as they are called
* [Request Routing](/TODO): loading the correct Page class to handle the request
* [Asset Management](/TODO): serving CSS, JavaScript, image and other media files
* [Event Hooks](/TODO): a callback mechanism for running code at specific points in the execution process
* [Authentication & Authorization](/TODO): controlling access to the application and its features
* [Error Handling](/TODO): help with handling and logging various types of error
* [Testing](/TODO): a simple but rather useful built-in unit testing framework.

## The Application Object

As we've said, the topmost object in the Runtime Object Tree is your `$app` object, which is extended from an API class. Most of the Core features are provided through the `$app` object. 

There are a number of API classes available in the Core, and you can extend them yourself to add any specific features you commonly require. The main Core APIs are:

* [ApiCLI](/TODO): a minimal frontend for command line requests
* [ApiWEB](/TODO): a minimal frontend for web applications, mainly used for integrating with other frameworks
* [ApiFrontend](/TODO): extends ApiWeb with routing, default page layouts and Page classes

There are other more specialised APIs for installers and REST requests.

API classes descend from AbstractView, because they are generally used to create output.

## Addons

Outside the Core there's a growing ecosystem of Agile Toolkit Addons. Official Addons are distributed in the `/atk4-addons` directory. They cover functionality such as internationalization and a range of useful user interface widgets.

We have recently launched an [Addon marketplace](/TODO) for community and commercial Addons. It's early days, but we plan to expand this rapidly and invite you to contribute.

<!-- Will this be launched in time? -->
