OPEN DIAGRAM EDITING

To enable community members to edit diagrams on different platforms we have adopted the open SVG file format.

So diagrams can be edited in the Open Source drawing application Inkscape or, at least in theory, in any other drawing application supporting SVG.

You will also need the Open Source Ubuntu font:

and the Open Source Iconic icon set which comes in SVG format:

STYLE GUIDE

To prevent diagrams from dominating the text, we have adopted a fairly plain style based on the Apple iOS documentation. There are examples in the file diagram-style-examples.png.

The file diagram-template.svg contains primitives for the commonly used shapes already styled with our diagram palette. Copy it and use it as the foundation for new diagrams. There's a spare in diagram-template.svg.bak in case someone overwrites it by accident!

For convenience, we author all the diagrams for a section in a single file.

Diagrams should be exported as .png files without alpha and placed in the same directory as the article in which it is displayed.
