Depending on the requirement you can choose from 3 parent classes: `Model_Table`, `Model` or `AbstractModel`: 

- `Model_Table` is the most commonly used and offers powerful [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) features for working with relational databases
- `Model` provides a pluggable interface to NoSQL data storage, Arrays and Sessions
- `AbstractModel` is a minimal Model used to develop alternative implementations.
