# Architecture & Design > Anatomy Of An Application

## Core Features

The Agile Toolkit Core handles the plumbing of your application. The key features are:

* [Configuration](/TODO): configuring the application and Controllers
* [Class Loading](/TODO): automatic lazy loading of classes as they are called
* [Request Routing](/TODO): loading the correct Page class to handle the request
* [Asset Management](/TODO): serving CSS, JavaScript, image and other media files
* [Event Hooks](/TODO): a callback mechanism for running code at specific points in the execution process
* [Authentication & Authorization](/TODO): controlling access to the application and its features
* [Error Handling](/TODO): help with handling and logging various types of error
* [Testing](/TODO): a simple but rather useful built-in unit testing framework.
