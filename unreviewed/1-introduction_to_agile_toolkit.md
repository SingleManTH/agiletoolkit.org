# Introduction to Agile Toolkit
The Agile Toolkit is a software development platform for creating Web Software using PHP 
language. Unlike many other PHP frameworks today, Agile Toolkit focuses on depth, 
simplification and sophistication. The goals of Agile Toolkit is make web development
more efficient without introducing overheads typically associated with frameworks.

Agile Toolkit is based on some philosophical concepts for easier learning. By Learning 
the way of Agile Toolkit, you will discover a new approach to build web applications in 
general. Many concepts might be new or might seem unusual, but you fill find the dynamic 
synergy behind them and the rest of the toolkit.

In this chapter I will explain what motivated me to create Agile Toolkit and why other
frameworks failed to provide a good-enough solution. I will also look at the number of
challenges developers face daily and how Agile Toolkit solves them.
The biggest mistake you could make when learning Agile Toolkit is if you assume it to be
yet another framework. There are fundamental differences which I will attempt to
communicate to you in this chapter.
The rest of the book will focus on all the components of Agile Toolkit and how the 
low-level implementation is abstracted and used to build a higher level of the toolkit. 
You will be able to see Agile Toolkit in three dimensions.
