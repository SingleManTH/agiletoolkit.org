# Relational Model Use (ORM)

Let's do a quick review. First, we have created and abstracted SQL queries through a query builder. Next we have created and abstracted model fields. Now we need to tie them together through our ORM implementation and this will give us table abstraction. Lets create model for "Book"```
class Model_Book extends Model_Table {	public $table='book';	function init(){		parent::init();		$this->addField('title');		$this->addField('is_published')->type('boolean');		$this->addField('cost')->type('money');	}}
```

## Manipulating Model Fields	```
$m=$this->add('Model_Book'); $m['title']='Jungle Book';$m['year']=123; var_Dump($m->get()); // shows title and year```
The important thing about Agile Toolkit models, is that you can add more fields dynamically at any time.```$m->addField('abstract');$m['abstract']='Lorem Ipsum ..';```Ability to take an existing model and add more fields allows us to extend existing models into new ones:
```
class Model_Published_Book extends Model_Book {	function init(){		parent::init();		$this->addField('issn');		$this->addCondition('is_published',true);	}}
```

but not only we can add additional fields, we can also add conditions, which would permanently change model's data-set.## Loading and Saving Models	
```$m1=$this->add('Model_Book');$m1['title']='Jungle Book';$m1->save();echo $m1->id;	// will output book's idecho $m1['is_published'];	// null $m2=$this->add('Model_Published_Book');$m2->tryLoad($m1->id);echo $m2->loaded();			// false. Condition not met```
Let's try this other way around:```$m1=$this->add('Model_Book_Published');$m1['title']='Jungle Book';$m1->save();echo $m1->id;	// will output book's idecho $m1['is_published'];	// true $m2=$this->add('Model_Book');$m2->tryLoad($m1->id);echo $m2->loaded();			// true
```

Models can be loaded by using either ID key or other field:```$m=$this->add('Model_User');$m->load(1);	// loads by id $m->loadBy('email',$email); $m->loadBy('id',$array_of_ids); $m->orderBy('title')->tryLoadAny();	// loads first record
```

So far no surprises. Any model can also produce a DSQL of itself to be used to build a custom queries:```$m=$this->add('Model_User');$m->count()->getOne();   // returns number $m->sum('age')->getOne();	// returns age $m->dsql()->del('fields')->field('avg(age)')->getOne();	// custom field query```
One of the up-sides of Agile Toolkit ORM is it's support for expressions. Let's go back to our Book / Chapter example:```$q=$this->add('Model_Book')->dsql()->del('fields')	->field('id')->where('is_published',1);
 $c=$this->add('Model_Chapter')	->addCondition('book_id',$q);```
Now the model $c will have it's data-set dynamically restricted to only published books. Let's create some data:```$m1=$this->add('Model_Book')->set('name','Jungle Book')	->set('is_published',true)->saveAndUnload(); $m2=$this->add('Model_Book')->set('name','jQuery Book')	->set('is_published',false)->save(); $c->set('name','Jungle Chapter 1')->set('book_id',$m1->id)	->save();	// will be successful $c->set('name','jQuery Chapter 1')->set('book_id',$m2->id)	->save();	// will fail
```

What about browsing:```echo $c->count()->debug()->getOne(); // select count(*) from chapter where book_id in //   (select id from book where is_published=1)
```

We can use this technique again for the Section model, however this time, we will use a method fieldQuery():```$s=$this->add('Model_Section')	->addCondition('chapter_id',$c->fieldQuery('id');
 echo $s->count()->getOne(); // select count(*) from section where chapter_id in// (select id from chapter where book_id in //   (select id from book where is_published=1))
```

This is cool, but too much typing and manipulating with the models. I am going to show you a small example from the further chapters on how this can be simplified:```echo $this->add('Model_Book')	->addCondition('is_published',true)	->ref('Chapter/Section')	->count()->getOne(); // select count(*) from section where chapter_id in// (select id from chapter where book_id in //   (select id from book where is_published=1))// - although may also use "join" if appropriate
```

As you can see in the examples, you can achieve things on a low level with some effort, but the low level gets abstracted more and more to reveal new beautiful syntax.## Model Aliasing	In some situations you must resort to table aliases to avoid clashes:```// select a.id,a.title,(select count(*) from book b//  where b.author_id=a.author_id) cnt from book a
```

The query above shows number of books written by the same author. But how do you write this code with the ORM? First let's try to build the query for our expression:```$q=$this->add('Model_Book',array('alias'=>'b'))->count();$m=$this->add('Model_Book',array('alias'=>'a'));$m->addExpression('cnt')->set($q	->where($q->getField('author_id'), 		$m->getElement('author_id'));
```

This might seem confusing, let's clean it up:```$m=$this->add('Model_Book',array('alias'=>'a'));$m->addExpression('cnt')->set(	$m->newInstance(array('alias'=>'b'))	->addCondition('author_id',$m->getElement('author_id'))	->count());
```

Let's review what's happening there. First we create a model, but we pass alias property which will affect all the queries generated by that model to use the specific alias. Next we create a new instance of the book but this time we use a different alias. At this point we have 2 models, identical, but with different aliases.
Next I'm setting condition on a second model (b) where author_id field equals to author_id of the first model. It's done by passing Field object into a condition, which will then end up inside a DSQL object and will be properly expanded.Finally our (b) model produces query for a count which is then used as an expression for the 'cnt' field.Agile Toolkit will properly prefix fields with the table name if more than one table is used in a query.
## Field Expressions	Agile Toolkit treats all types of fields with an absolute consistency. In other words, anywhere where a physical field can be used, you can also use expression. Here is an example:```
$m=$this->add('Model_Author');$m->addExpression('book_cnt')	->set($m->refSQL('Book')->count()); $m->addCondition('age',$m->getElement('book_cnt'));
```

This will create a model with only authors who wrote same amount of books as their age is. Someone who is 32 years old and wrote 32 books would match the condition.The important point here is that 'age' could be either a physical field or another expression and regardless of that the model will properly build the query.As a developer you have a full abstraction of a field and expressions.Here is another example, which uses one field expression to build another field expression:```
$m=$this->add('Model_Author');$m->addExpression('full_name')	->set($m->dsql()->concat(		$m->getElement('name'),' ',		$m->getElement('surname')	));$m->addExpression('full_email')->set(	$m->dsql()->concat(		$m->getElement('email'),' <',		$m->getElement('name'),'>'));
```You will begin to appreciate these qualities as your project grows. Agile Toolkit is not only trying you to help build query. It provides PROPER abstraction of query fields and expressions.Any of the models above can be used with views or for addressing individual records. There are other ways to use expressions and I'll get back to them in further sections.## Iterating through records	When model is being iterated, it produces the id / data array pair.```foreach($this->add('Book') as $id=>$book){	echo "$id: ".$book['title']."\n";}// 1: Jungle Book// 2: jQuery Book
```


The actual model will be also loaded and can be used much more flexibly than the produced array. Also you must note that Agile Toolkit will never retrieve a full result set unless you specifically ask for it. The iterations will happen as you read data. Here is a slightly different format:```foreach($book=$this->add('Book') as $junk){	echo $book->id.": ".$book['title']."\n";}// 1: Jungle Book// 2: jQuery Book
```

Be mindful of the expressions here. Book object is created first, then it's assigned to $book variable. Then the object is iterated and stores results in $junk array. We are not really interested in it, but we work with object directly.
One way is to update records on the fly here or perform traversal:```foreach($book=$this->add('Book') as $junk){	echo $book->id.": ".$book['title']." by ".		$book->ref('Author')->get('name')."\n";}// 1: Jungle Book by Joe Blogs// 2: jQuery Book by John Smith```
**WARNING: traversing references inside a loop is very bad for scalability. Your previous favorite ORM might left you no other options, but with Agile Toolkit you can:**
```$book=$this->add('Book');$book->join('author')->addField('author_name','name');foreach($book as $junk){	echo $book->id.": ".$book['title']." by ".		$book['author_name']."\n";}// 1: Jungle Book by Joe Blogs// 2: jQuery Book by John Smith```You already saw how to create subqueries, but this example adds a join and pulls field from a join. Note that we are also adding field under a different alias.## Timestamps	Things like timestamps, soft-delete and other features tend to appear as a built-in feature in other ORMs. Agile Toolkit has no built-in support for either, but with the basic features of Agile Toolkit Models you can implement these features easily.```$model->addField('deleted')->system(true)->type('boolean');$model->addCondition('deleted',false);$model->addHook('beforeDelete',function($m){	$m->set('deleted',true)->saveAndUnload();	$m->breakHook(false);});
```


Timestamps are equally easy to implement:```$model->addField('created')->type('datetime')	->defaultValue($model->dsql()->expr('now()'));$model->addField('updated')->type('datetime');$model->addHook('beforeSave',function($m){	$m['updated']=$m->dsql()->expr('now()');});
```

How about if we pack this functionality into a nice controller?```class Controller_SoftDelete extends AbstractController {	function init(){		parent::init();		$this->owner->addField('deleted')			->system(true)->type('boolean');		$this->owner->addCondition('deleted',false);		$this->owner->addHook('beforeDelete',function($m){			$m->set('deleted',true)->saveAndUnload();			$m->breakHook(false);		});	}} $model->setController('SoftDelete');	// simple use```
## Relations
You may define relations between models like this:    $book->hasMany('Chapters');    $book->hasOne('Author');
    
Later you can traverse by using `ref()` or `refSQL()`. For example, let's create a CRUD for editing list of chapters of a current book:```
$this->add('CRUD')->setModel(	$this->add('Model_Book')->load($id)->ref('Chapters'));
```

You might have already noticed one example with refSQL. When you are defining relations you can also specify which fields to use. The next chapter will look into Model() in details.This should just give you a brief idea about relations and I will detail them further.
