# Creating your first Command-Line application
You can create software for a variety of different targets with Agile Toolkit including command-line software or software which does not produce HTML.Let's look at how to implement the simplest hello world in Agile Toolkit. ```include 'atk4/loader.php';$api = new ApiCLI();echo "Hello World\n";
```

The creation of the API class does almost nothing and is a very lightweight operation. Once you have created your $api class you can perform various things with it. For example, we can attempt to read a configuration parameter```include 'atk4/loader.php';$api = new ApiCLI();echo $api->getConfig('greeting',"Hello World\n");
```

This will open the config.php file in the same folder, and look for the following line:    $config['greeting']='Hello from Agile Toolkit';
and the output now would be different. Let's also connect to a MySQL database by adding the following line inside config.php:
```$config['dsn']='mysql://root:secret@127.0.0.1/myproject';// add to main PHP file:$api->dbConnect();
```

I will revisit work with database in Chapter 3 - Data Model.
