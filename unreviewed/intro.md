This is a script for the first-page video introducing Agile Toolkit.

Mood: Empowering, letting kids and developers do what they couldn't have done before. Building for next generation.


Romans: Agile Toolkit have always been about empowering developers. =

Narrator: Started in 1999 by a Romans Malinovskis, Agile Toolkit have been evolving behind the scenes as a private framework. With the release of Agile Toolkit 4.0 it finally became available for a wide audience. 

Romans: It was a great timing. A new version of PHP 5 came out with the great new object-oriented features and it was finally ready to realize what I have planned for 10 years. An Object-Oriented Web UI framework.

Romans: In a way - Agile Toolkit is a back-bone for someone new to the world of web development. Instead of fragmented technologies and solutions, you have a clear path in front of you. We didn't reinvent a wheel, we invented a staircase.

Narrator: The initial reaction to Agile Toolkit was not great. Lack of documentation, cryptic source code and low compatibility were factors to slow it's adoption. For the last few years Romans and a team of early adopters have been tackling one issue after another. The Agile Toolkit of today is a clean, well-documented, compatible and extensible framework.

Romans: We have great adoption of Agile Toolkit in the higher education and self-employed professional, areas where people can appreciate innovation and can embrace a new, better workflow.

Narrator: The reason, why it's called a Toolkit is because Agile can be a drop-in solution for your User Interface. It works with any other framework or web technology and can help you produce a clean and customizable HTML. However for a large web projects based on Agile Toolkit, you would also take advantage of it's framework features and a powerful Object Relational Manager.

Romans: Object Relational Manager communicates with relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL. It's goal is to severely reduce number of queries and latency by taking advantage of rich SQL syntax: expressions, sub-selects, joins. Before even introducing Caching in your application, it will perform much faster than if you would have based your software on any other framework.

Narrator: User interface and a powerful ORM are really powerful parts of Agile Toolkit which you can start using today, but there is yet another breakthrough not yet seen anywhere else.

Romans: Agile Toolkit creates a link between views you see on the page and PHP objects. Each object not only is able to render HTML, but it can communicate between your browser and a back-end. Agile Toolkit allows a short line of javascript code to reload any part of the page efficiently, without any additional effort. That's a big thing. 

Narrator: A bridge between jQuery and PHP. Bringing JavaScript events into PHP. This way you can take a PHP Button object and bind it's click event to reloading any other portion of your page.

Narrator: But let's take a step back and take another look at Agile Toolkit. It's compatible with everything else out there, standard-compliant teaches you to think with objects. It can be used for quickly putting together admin interface or building your application altogether. And what's really important, it's an insanely extensible, allowing you to take advantage of the plugin system.

Romans: When you are building add-on for Agile Toolkit, your lowest common denominator is way up here. You don't worry about the interface, theme, file locations, URL patterns or compatibility with any other add-ons. You focus on getting results done.

Narrator: And that's a great thing for developers who value their time. Let me put it this way - Agile Toolkit IS very different to PHP Framework and toolkits you have seen so far. You will need some time to get used to it.

Romans: Less than a month. That's what it takes to learn Agile Toolkit. You start by learning patterns, concepts and framework goals. There is a free book to guide you through. Once you know, you build new and new concept on a solid foundation. I promise you that as developer you won't be able to look back.
