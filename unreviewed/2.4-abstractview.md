# AbstractViewThe object of AbstractView inherits all of the functionality from AbstarctObject, but has some new methods. It also introduces property “template”, which contains SMLite object.## defaultTemplate()	When view is initialized, it prepares it's default template by creating new SMLite object under “template” property. This template by default is initialized by cloning region “Content” of the owner's template. In the previous section I have described how to create a “shared.html” file, which can then be loaded inside a template. Let's look in more details at how shared.html would look:  ```<html><head>...</head><body>  <?Header?>  <div class="header">    <img src="img1.png"/>    <img src="img2.png"/>  </div>  <?/Header?>  <div>    <?Content?>      <h3>Default Content</h3>      <p>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit... </p>    <?/Content?>  </div></body>
```

Let's create a simple view object which would load this template:```include 'atk4/loader.php';$api = new ApiCLI();$view = $api->add('View',null,null,array('shared'));$view->template->trySet('Content')->set('Hello World'); echo $view->getHTML();
```

The 4th argument specifies which template so use and because we want our view to load template from a file, we are using array('shared');Next, let's try to add another view inside our existing view to which we can delegate the work related to making the header look well. For now, let's have the new view clone the <?Header?> region.```$header = $view->add('View',null,'Header','Header');echo $view->getHTML();
```

Adding this will have no effect on the output, however you will have a separate view rendering the header recursively. Next I'll create a class object for the header and will use this class instead of "View".```class MyHeader extends AbstractView {  function render(){    $this->output('Header now works differently');  }} $header = $view->add('MyHeader',null,'Header','Header');
```

Let me clue you in on the arguments to the add(). The 3rd argument specifies the spot within the $view where the text will appear every time header would call output().  I have made one omission on purpose. My new object outputs without use of the template. Normally a view would work with it's own template and then output the data into the parent. Here is the "default" render method:```function render(){   $this->output($this->template->render());}
```

The 4th argument for add() method describes how the template should be initialized. Before we have used array('shared') to load template from a file. Specifying string value will point to a region within a parent template, which will be cloned for a child view to use. In our case the default template for the MyHeader object would contain: `<div class="header">....</div>`Alternatively you could also specify both the file and a tag, in which case the template would be irrelevant to the owner's template: array('shared','Header')* $view->getHTML()  * $view->recursiveRender()    * $header->recursiveRender()    * $header->render()      * $header->template->render()      * $header->output()        * $view->template->appendHTML()    * $view->render()      * $view->output();Each view in Agile Toolkit renders itself recursively by calling it's render() method which then appends the output to owners tmpalte. In the conclusion of this chapter I should note that Application class also inherits AbstractView and therefore your $api also have a template.
