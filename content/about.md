Agile Toolkit is a Web UI Development Framework. It is inspired by GUI Applications Toolkits such as Qt, Cocoa, .NET and others. Agile Toolkit is specifically well suited for development of web projects using Agile methodologies.

### Is Agile Toolkit for me?

You should select Agile Toolkit over any different Web Framework:

 - if you wish to be time-efficient web developer
 - if you want your user interface to look consistently
 - if you to keep "look and feel" separately from "presentation logic"
 - if you are task-focused and if you value modularity
 - if you understand and respect object-oriented approach
 - if you and your team using Agile principles for development

## How is Agile Toolkit different from Framework X?

Following are some of the most significant advantages of Agile Toolkit over other frameworks:
 
#### Abstracted User Interface.
Developing of Views and Widgets should be independent from your application build. CRUD, DatePicker and Form classes is a good start, but why stop here? Agile Toolkit gives you loads of views and even more through add-ons. You can very easily add them into your code.

#### Object-Oriented ORM. 
A true object-oriented model organization for your code. We embrace use of inheritance, overriding, overloading, composition inside a low-level methods of your business code. This keeps your project more organized and much simpler to grow or change.

#### JavaScript Events and Bindings.
Use jQuery, jQuery UI or any other javascript framework of your choice directly from PHP. We make it super-easy for you to bind PHP actions with JavaScript events. Implementing AJAX have never been this simple. 

#### Integrated with Agile CSS Framework.
A powerful CSS framework specifically designed around the needs of Agile Toolkit. Enables you to build a stunning user interfaces even with very basic CSS skills. In fact - in most cases you wouldn't even need to touch CSS code.

## Goals of Agile Toolkit
As creators of Agile Toolkit we strive to deliver the best experience for web developers. We are proud to contribute to the PHP community and make it more enterprise-ready but more importantly - offer a "Best Practice" way of web development to those who only have started programming recently.

#### Agile Toolkit as your first framework
If you are new to web development, you could save a lot of time if you start learning Agile Toolkit right away. Other framework require you to understand how to write web apps from scratch before you use them. 

Agile Toolkit hides away all the technical and complex parts and leaves you to the pure object-oriented programming. 

#### A solid foundation for Agile Development
Agile Toolkit implements a unique approach to web development consisting of the following steps:

 1. Define Models and business logic.
 1. Instantly create Admin / CRUD.
 1. Implement User-Interface logic with help of re-usable Grids, Lists and Forms.
 1. Look for a great add-ons and other ways to visualize your data.
 1. Tweak by introducing your own new widgets and adjusting templates.
 1. Enhance overall look and feel of your application

What is significant about this approach? Well most importantly your business logic is ready early on, so you can start writing automated tests for it very early into the project. Secondly you get Admin system at no extra cost, it's very simple to put together. Finally your User Interface logic will be done very quickly into the project, so your business users could start using your app and start giving you feedback.

That's exactly what you need the most in Agile Toolkit. Start with Minimal Viable Product and tweak it into perfection while keeping your application well-tested.
