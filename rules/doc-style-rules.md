Documentation Style Rules
----

This doc will evolve ad-hoc as use-cases come up.

### General Rules

* Use US English
* Use informal English: "it's", not "it is" etc. But keep it professional - no slang.
* Be upbeat about the advantages of ATK but not boastful or disrespectful of other frameworks
* Use the 80/20 rule - document the 20% of features that offer 80% of the functionality. Developers can find the rest of the functionality in the API docs.

### Headings

* Use initial caps: **This Is A Heading Example**
* Use "&", not "and"

### Naming

* Use "Agile Toolkit" not "ATK4"
* Use "Addon" not "addon" or "add-on"
* For the ATK classes, capitalise View, Page, Model & Controller
* Use "method" for a function within a class (See PHP docs).
* Use "property" for a class-scope variable
* Use "variable" for a method-scope variable

### Links

* To link to the API, use the markup: [api://DB_dsql]
* To cross-link within the docs, use standard Markdown link notation

### Code examples

* Indent code blocks 4 spaces or 1 tab

### Comments

Use standard HTML comments: <!-- -->. We'll strip them out before publication. 

### Misc

* Booleans in the run of text: 'null', 'true', 'false', not NULL, null
