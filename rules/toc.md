Agile Toolkit Documentation: Table of Contents
========

Structure
-----

The docs are structured in 4 levels:

* 1st level - Headers in the TOC
* 2nd level - TOC links to a dedicated page in documentation
* 3nd level - Heads within the dedicated page (anchors)
* 4th level - Subheads within the dedicated page.

Style rules
----

* Use US English
* Use "Agile Toolkit" not "ATK4"
* Use Initial Caps: **This Is A Heading Example**
* Use "&", not "and"
* Indent code blocks 4 spaces
* Indicate a link of the docs with an arrow ->


* Use "method" for a function within a class (See PHP docs).

Markdown has no syntax for comments that should be stripped out. We use markup that will make it easy to remove comments with a script:

* General comments: ((My comment))
* URLs: [/foo].

Issues For Discussion
-----

* Controllers
	((Can we set up a Skype chat about controllers? I need to be sure I understand them, and the docs are a bit weak on this. My tentative idea is to explain them in terms of 1) Shared application-wide services such as data connections and validation where we don't want the overhead of initialising multiple objects, 2) Local services where we don't mind if controllers are initialised more than once, 3) Business logic. This might help users coming from other frameworks to map the ATK approach to Controllers to more familiar IoC thinking. Can you point me at some use-cases for business logic controllers. I'm still unclear on what goes in a Model and what would go in a Controller))
  * ((Move up, generalize, then break-down by topic))
  * Overview of Controllers
  * Built-in Controllers
  * Creating your own Controllers

* Official addons

  * ((add-ons would be separate, but we need add-on development guide))
((Why woudn't we document the official addons here?))
  * Campaign Monitor CMS
  * CRUD  // no longer add-on, move to view
  * Documentation Engine // irrelevant

  * Filestore
  * Google Maps
  * SQL Schema Generator  // explained elsewhere
* Cookbook  // shouldn't be section in DOC, whole new category on site!
  * A useful cookbook entry

  * Another useful cookbook entry

  * A final useful cookbook entry

  * See more Cookbook recipes ->

 * ((Localization))

((I would argue for an official addon ASAP. This is partly selfish, as I'd prefer to build our site using community supported code! If we can sort out the routing and asset loading issues, I could get a draft to you in a couple of days of work based on the stuff I did for Laravel. You guys could clean it up and turn it into decent code!))

((PRIORITIES: we're going to have around 50 sections, some short, but some quite long and demanding. Quite a big project. What are our priorities? Do we just start at the beginning and work down?))
