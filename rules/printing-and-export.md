Documentation Formats
====
Official documentation for Agile Toolkit and all the add-ons to be composed in Markdown (with some extensions). The website will include Markdown parser for converting MD into HTML and showing on the page.

Documentations may contain executable examples. They would be executed inside a sand-box and presented inside an iframe.

Documentation Pages
----
Documentation would be dividid into topics, but each topic would fully fit inside a single page. To speed up documentation loading, we could load some sections dynamically, or as user scrolls down the page.

Markdown includes
----
Markdown may contain directives to include other files. This can be handy to split down longer documentation pages but make them presentable still. The included files must contain underscore which would prevent them from being visible directly through the web.
